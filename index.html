  <h2>Mission</h2>
  
  <p class="bold">Empowering businesses and individuals to create, exchange and capture value in the decentralized creative economy</p>
  
  <h3>Products, platforms, protocols. Where will your business capture value?</h3>
  
  <p>Blockchain technology has opened the door for inclusive business models. Individuals can now create, own and exchange valuable, funtional assets (tokens), essential to interactions with brands and services. The feature is digital scarcity, the benefit is disintermediation of value creation and exchange. Product is what you sell, platform is where you broadcast and protcol is where customers participate. The future of perceived value is capturing the network between individual actions and new business models. How will you capture value?</p>
